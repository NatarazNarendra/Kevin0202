The IllegalArgumentException in Java
The IllegalArgumentException is a good way of handling possible errors in your application’s code.
This exception indicates that a method is called with incorrect input arguments. 
Then, the only thing you must do is correct the values of the input parameters. In order to achieve that,
follow the call stack found in the stack trace and check which method produced the invalid argument.


This exception extends the RuntimeException class and thus belongs to 
those exceptions that can be thrown during the operation of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
It is an unchecked exception and thus, it does not need to be declared in a method’s or a constructor’s throws clause. 
Finally, the IllegalArgumentException exists since the first version of Java (1.0).
 How to deal with the java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
When the IllegalArgumentException is thrown, you must check the call stack in Java’s stack trace and locate the method that produced the wrong argument.
The IllegalArgumentException is very useful and can be used to avoid situations where your application’s code would have to deal with unchecked input data.
